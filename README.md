$ python
print ("This is a crap. I had to do it because I couldn't start it on my own. Once I do it I am surely going to throw it. 
This is another part of crap. It's fun generating crap here and there. I don't understand it fully, Well I want to. I have to start working on my thesis, being a procrastinator I will start it from tomorrow. 

Is it cool enough?")
